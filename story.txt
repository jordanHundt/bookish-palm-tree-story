There once was a guy named Jeff who lived in the city.  He had not eaten
dinner and he was hungry.  There were so many places he could go and he
wanted to go to all of them.  Unforturnately, that was not possible because
he had to get home with enough time to do laundry.

On the way home, he realized that he was more hungry than he expected. Then he found out a fact
that help him to change the decision. People won't die not doing the laundry but will die if he do
not have dinner. He stepped into the closest resterant, a terrible college dinning hall;

Jeff realized how terrible the college dining hall was and decided to just
order a small dessert. Taking his first bite, he realized the chocolate cookie
was much better than he thought. Leaving the dining hall, he decided to move
on to eat some ramen at a nearby restaurant. He travelled from restaurant to
restaurant and by the time he got back, he realized his laundry machine had
broken down!

His only option was to go to the laundromat because it would take too long to
get a maintenance guy.  All of his clothes were wet so he put them all into a
garbage bag inorder not to ruin anything.  He brought another bag along for 
after his clothes were clean.  Unfortunately, when he got there he found out
that it closed at 10 and that he would not have enough time to do his laundry.
Now, all he could do was buy new clothes.  So he looked online for open stores
and found a Walmart not too far away.  He bought new clothes for the next day,
and went to bed exhausted that night.  Hopefully he would find time to do
laundry tomorrow.
