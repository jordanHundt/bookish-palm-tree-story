There once was a guy named Jeff who lived in the city.  He had not eaten
dinner and he was hungry.  There were so many places he could go and he
wanted to go to all of them.  Unforturnately, that was not possible because
he had to get home with enough time to do laundry.

On the way home, he realized that he was more hungry than he expected. Then he found out a fact
that help him to change the decision. People won't die not doing the laundry but will die if he do
not have dinner. He stepped into the closest resterant, a terrible college dinning hall;

Jeff realized how terrible the college dining hall was and decided to just
order a small dessert. Taking his first bite, he realized the chocolate cookie
was much better than he thought. Leaving the dining hall, he decided to move
on to eat some ramen at a nearby restaurant. He travelled from restaurant to
restaurant and by the time he got back, he realized his laundry machine had
broken down!
